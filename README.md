# Overview

I wrote a basic sampler for the rust language that goes over the syntax of how rust basically works with the foundational elements of the language.

I wrote this software with the purpose of gaining an understanding of how the Rust language works. It is meant to be a helpful reference for me to look back on when I write more complex programs.

# Development Environment

I wrote these files in VS Code
I created this directory by using Cargo, which comes with Rust

I used Rust 1.60.0

# Future Work
* Extend the documentation.
* Connect the various .rs files in src to main.rs and run them all when using cargo run
